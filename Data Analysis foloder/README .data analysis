# Netflix Data Analysis

This is the third week of our internship with futurense technologies,here we were asked to analyis the netflix data,that was shared by a csv 
file.given in this folder...

This project involves the analysis of Netflix data to gain insights into the content available on the platform. The dataset used contains 
information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including details such as title, director, cast, release year, duration,
rating, and more.

Tools Used:

Python: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization were performed using Python programming language.
Libraries:

NumPy: For numerical operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For basic data visualization.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
Plotly: For interactive and advanced data visualization.

Analysis Steps
Loading the Data: The dataset (netflix_titles.csv) was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

Initial Exploration:
Displayed the first few rows of the DataFrame to understand its structure and contents.
Used the describe() function to get descriptive statistics of the dataset.
Checked column names using df.columns.
Obtained information about the dataset using df.info().

Data Cleaning:
Checked for missing values (df.isna().sum()).
Removed rows with missing values using dropna().

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Created a count plot for the distribution of content types (Movies/TV Shows).
Filtered the dataset to analyze movies specifically (movie = netflix[netflix['type'] == 'Movie']).
Further analysis could include exploring the distribution of genres, directors, release years, etc.

Visualization:
Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations.
